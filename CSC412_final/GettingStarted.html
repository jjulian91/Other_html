           <div> Backpacking is one of the most rewarding activities you can under take.  Most people are unwilling to accept the 
        idea of living off of only what you are able to carry, those people are only hindering their own journey of life.  
        The most beautiful places on earth are those which are generally unvisited by humans.  There is an innate beauty of the 
        natural world that is inaccessible for those who are not willing to challenge themselves physically and mentally.  This 
        page is going to give those of you willing to adapt to this nomadic lifestyle a place to start your journey.  We will be exploring the gear that
        is absolutely necessary to have a safe and enjoyable trip.  Check out the recommended trips page for a sneak peak into some of my
        own trip journals which will provide an over view of the trip, some things to watch out for and even photos of the hike itself.

              <div class="centered" id="Title">Gear</div>
                <div>The first place to start after accepting the challenging life style of backpacking is going to be your local outdoor retailer. 
                        There are plenty of reputable dealers both online and in most cities.  There is really no absolute best retailer for any particular type of equipment
                        My personal opinion of the best places to begin to shop for gear are:   </div>

                <p class="mb-1">REI is a member owned Co-Op which provides a great atmosphere to try new equipment. The employees are all well
                trained in the departments in which they work so you will be sure you're getting the best equipment for the activity you're interested in. 
                Purchasing a $20 membership allows you to take ownership in the business and get a 5% return on any full price purchases made. 
                They have a 1 year no questions asked return policy and they offer quarterly sales.  </p>

                <p class="mb-1">Back Country edge is an online based equipment retailer. They offer extensive video tutorials for a majority
                of the items they sell.  They typically give 20% off the first full price item you buy and they also provide a very extensive 
                return policy in most cases up to 1 year after purchase.  Their gear heads are available typically everyday via online chat and 
                will be sure that you get the best equipment for your situation.</p>

                and operated by backcounry.com (not to be confused with backcountryedge.com), but this is the fastest way to find the best deals offered

                 When searching for your first trip there are a bunch of things you need to keep in mind.  First and foremost is taking into account
                 your own ability.  One of the most crucial things about backpacking is risk mitigation.  Although backpacking is rewarding in terms of being able
                 to push your own physical and mental boundaries, you must be able to identify your own limitations.  I would not recommend someone to take on a 
                 trail like the entire lost coast trail as a thru-hike in 3-4 days as your first trip.  Anyone is capable to do any trail with enough time and
                 supplies, but the 2 most important rules are time and preparedness.  Here are a list of the my top 10 rules for a safe and enjoyable back country trek:
